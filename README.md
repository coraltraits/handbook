# Introduction and discussion

### 1. Selection of species and individuals

- Selection of species
- Selection of individuals within a species
- Replicate measurements

### Whole-plant traits

- Life history and maximum plant lifespan
- Life form
- Growth form
- Plant height
- Clonality, bud banks and below-ground storage organs
- Spinescence
- Branching architecture
- Leaf area : sapwood area ratio
- Root-mass fraction
- Salt resistance
- Relative growth rate and its components
- Plant flammability
- Water-flux traits

### Polyp traits

- Specific leaf area
- Area of a leaf
- Leaf dry-matter content
- Leaf thickness
- pH of green leaves or leaf litter
- Leaf N concentration and leaf phosphorus (P) concentration
- Physical strength of leaves
- Leaf lifespan and duration of green foliage
- Vein density
- Light-saturated photosynthetic rate
- Leaf dark respiration
- Photosynthetic pathway
- C-isotope composition as a measure of intrinsic water-use efficiency
- Electrolyte leakage as an indicator of frost sensitivity
- Leaf water potential as a measure of water status
- Leaf palatability as indicated by preference by model herbivores
- Litter decomposability

### Stem traits

- Stem-specific density
- Twig dry-matter content and twig drying time
- Bark thickness (and bark quality)
- Xylem conductivity
- Vulnerability to embolism

### Below-ground traits

- Specific root length
- Root-system morphology
- Nutrient-uptake strategy

### Regenerative traits

- Dispersal syndrome
- Dispersule size and shape
- Dispersal potential
- Seed mass
- Seedling functional morphology
- Resprouting capacity after major disturbance
